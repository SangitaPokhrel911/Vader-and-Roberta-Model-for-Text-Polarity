# Vader-and-Roberta-Model-for-Text-Polarity
In this project, I have implemented a tourist review sentiment analysis Model that helps classify the reviews of different destinations as either positive, negative, or neutral. The goal of this study is to determine the proportion of negative, positive, and neutral, which allow us to understand the satisfaction of the tourist while visiting Nepal.
